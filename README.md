# The Guide Of Basic Knowledge

## Description

The motivation behind this project was encouraged by the coding bootcamp at SMU. 
This project was designed to help myself and others log spurts of information that is learned to be easily accessible in the event it is needed at a later date. Also to give a small insight on what it's like to indugle in a coding project at a basic level.
The problem that I solved was being able to compact multiple learning attributes into one document that can be accessed and updated to my liking.
I was able to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript. All of which is noted inside the actual webpage.
